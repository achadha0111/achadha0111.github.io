I am an engineer who works across the atoms to bits stack. I did my PhD in Nanosciences at the University of Manchester, where I built nanomaterials-based
photodetectors, wireless power transfer systems and designed some really tiny circuit boards at the [National Graphene Institute](https://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/ngi/). Before that, I worked as a data engineer at [TickX](https://www.tickx.com) and did an undergraduate
degree in Artificial Intelligence. I also spent [some time](https://substack.com/@actinkers/note/p-154258835) at [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com) in London. Currently exploring neurotechnology and quantum computing.
