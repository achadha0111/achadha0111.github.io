I am an engineer who works across the atoms to bits stack. I did my PhD in Nanosciences at the University of Manchester, where I built nanomaterials based
photodetectors, wireless power transfer systems and designed some really tiny circuit boards. Before that, I worked as a data engineer and did an undergraduate
degree in Artificial Intelligence. Currently exploring neurotechnology and quantum computing.
