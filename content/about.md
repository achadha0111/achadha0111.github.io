## Research Experience

**PhD Candidate Researcher**, [NEST Group](https://nest.cs.manchester.ac.uk), University of Manchester, **2019-2024**
- I developed a wireless, photodetector platform for smart contact lenses. I devised the fabrication process utilising photolithography, etching and deposition and implemented it in a C100 cleanroom at the [National Graphene Institute](https://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/ngi/). Designed a 3.5mm x 3.5mm flexible PCB to host a microcontroller chip for contact lens operation.
- As part of this work, I also designed, fabricated and tested wireless power transfer coils for near field communication (13.56MHz). I used finite element modelling in COMSOL to design and simulate the coils. I also characterised these coils using the [PocketVNA](https://pocketvna.com) and a good, old fashioned oscilloscope. 
- Wrote an assortment of [measurement automation scripts](https://github.com/achadha0111/NEST-Instruments-Controller) for the Keithley2450.
- [Won Â£20,000](https://bit.ly/3LAzLxS) at the Eli Britt Harari competition to further explore the use of nanomaterials in novel applications.

**Research Assistant**, [Interaction Analysis and Modelling Lab](https://admiring-blackwell-464759.netlify.app), University of Manchester, **2017-2018**
- Led an independent project on wearable strain sensing using graphene tattoo sensors that won the [Global Undergraduate Award in Engineering](https://undergraduateawards.com/winners/global-winners-2019) in 2019.
- Developed a [Java application](https://github.com/achadha0111/sensortag-aware) to extract data from the TI-AWARE platform for unobtrusive monitoring of people with Parkinson's Disease.
